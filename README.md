# BabyGandalph

## The Objective:

The goal is to do tasks and grow BabyGandalphs abilities. When they reache a certain age, if their abilities are not of a certain level, the Wizard Sanctum will not accept him into their ranks. The player will be responsible for leveling up their ability score by casting the spell of the players choosing. As BG casts spells and eats their favorite food, they gets fatigued. If the player ignores the fatigue bar and lets their fatigue max out, it will increase the age counter. This will give the player less time to train their ability score and potentially be declined by the Wizard Sanctum.


## User Stories
As a player of BabyGandalph, I want to take care of Baby Gandalph and keep them happy as they grow into a strong wizard. As the player, I would like several tasks to be responsible for that will ensure they stay alive and keeps their magic strong. To outline a few MVP features:

### Players are responsible for:
- As a player, I want to feed BG to reduce their hunger bar.
- As a player, I want to train their skills to increase their skill level..
- As a player I want to let BG meditate when their fatigue bar is full.



## How the game will play 

Upon opening the game, the user will be asked to give BabyGandalph a new name. There will be a few helpful pop ups that describe what things do on the screen., explaining the mission of the player. The player will have 100 years to hit a skill level of 3, 100 years to hit level 5, and then for the final test 100 years to hit level 10. In order to be accepted into the Wizard Sanctum at the end of the game, the player must be level 10. There will be three buttons that the user can click. One button that raises the players skill bar (and add fatigue), one that resets their fatigue bar and adds a day to the counter, and one that decreases their hunger bar (and adds fatigue). If BG's fatigue bar reach a maximum value, extra days will be added to the counter. At level 3 and level 6, BabyGandalph will evolve into a more powerful wizard. Upon reaching skill level 10, BabyGandalph will reach their final form and be accepted into the Wizard Sanctum, and the player wins the game. If upon year 100, the player is not level 10 when the Wizard Sanctum approach, the player is turned away and results in a loss.
