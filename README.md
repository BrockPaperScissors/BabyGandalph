# BabyGandalph

## The Objective:

The goal is to do tasks and grow BabyGandalphs abilities. When he reaches a certain age, if his abilities are not of a certain level, the Wizard Sanctum will not accept him into their ranks. The player will be responsible for leveling up his ability score by completeing tasks. As BG performs tasks, he gets fatigued. If the player ignores the fatigue bar and lets his fatigue max out, it will increase the age counter. This will give the player less time to train his ability score and potentially be declined by the Wizard Sanctum.


## User Stories
As a player of BabyGandalph, I want to take care of Baby Gandalph and keep him happy as he grows into a strong wizard. As the player, I would like several tasks to be responsible for that will ensure he stays alive and keeps his magic strong. To outline a few MVP features:

### Players are responsible for:
- As a player, I want to feed him to contribute towards his growth bar.
- As a player, I want to take him outside to cast lightning bolts at soda cans to contribute towards his growth bar.
- As a player I want to put him in his blanket when he is tired from doing activities, to lower his fatigue bar.



## How the game will play 

Upon opening the game, the user will be asked to give BabyGandalph a new name. There will be a few helpful pop ups that describe what things do on the screen., explaining the mission of the player. The player will have 100 days to hit a skill level of 300 in order to be accepted into the Wizard Sanctum. There will be three buttons that the user can click, two that grant experience towards BabyGandalphs skill level (and add fatigue) and one that resets his fatigue bar and adds a day to the counter. If BG's fatigue bar reaches a maximum value, extra days will be added to the counter. At level 100 and level 200, BabyGandalph will mature and the three buttons will change to new activities. There will be three weather states. Sunny, Cloudy, and Rain. These will affect how much fatigue is gained by doing activities. Upon reaching skill level 300, BabyGandalph will reach his final form and be accepted into the Wizard Sanctum, and the player wins the game. If upon day 100, the player is not level 300 when the Wizard Sanctum approaches, the player is turned away and results in a loss.
